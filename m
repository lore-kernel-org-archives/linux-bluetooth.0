Hi,

PSM (protocol service multiplexer) is defined in RFCOMM. Basically it is
the channel two RFCOMM devices use to communicate. You may have more then
one RFCOMM channel on different PSMs between two Bluetooth devices.
Normaly the PSM needed to connect to a remote RFCOMM channel is found by
an SDP search (it is part of the service record).

Hope this helps. If not, RTFM......

Ciao,

Peter
