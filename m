Hi, I have a Toshiba Laptop with a Bluetooth USB device integrated in it.
I can use the BT device without problems in 2.4.22, but with 2.6.0-test9=20
it doesn't work for most of the time.

USB seems to be working just fine so that shouldn't be it.

The problem is that most of the time a "hcitool inq/scan" just returns
"Inquiring ..." immediatly, without any delay like it didn't do anything.

If I remove the modules and reload them over and over again it usually=20
works after a while and when it works it stays working until I decide to=20
reboot.

I've tried to enable some debugging in hci_usb.c but I don't understand
what to make out of it.. not much that seems wrong to me..

I get one error when loading the hci_usb module though:
hub 4-0:1.0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 2
hci_usb: probe of 4-1:1.1 failed with error -5

Don't know if it's related, the device seems fine and this showes up
even when the device happen to work.

Just let me know if there is something I can provide/test debug or=20
whatever..

This is my BT device:
