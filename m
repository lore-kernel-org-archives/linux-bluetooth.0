Hello,

Is there a way to perform a full reset of a USB dongle without 
unplugging it, but having the very same effects than if it was 
physically unplugged and plugged back again?

I encountered some firmware jams with my dongles, and the only solution 
to get them back to work again was to etither unplug them or to reboot 
the machine. This is quite annoying for some applications where system 
has to be up as much as possible, and has to self-recover unattented if 
something goes wrong.

Pierre-Yves
