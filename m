> Btw the bcm43438 is detected even after unloading and reloading the driver. But the timeout occurs also on driver reload. Reducing the baudrate to 115200 doesn't help here.

maybe it needs some time after switching the hardware on. Have you tried to sleep for a bit at the end of bcm_gpio_set_power?

Can you also dump where the Frame reassembly fails. Or correlate that with the btmon trace of which packets make its through. The 0x0c14 is Read Local Name and maybe we actually have bit errors here.

In theory we could also run this hardware in 3-wire protocol mode. I just do not know how to get that one started, but maybe that would be an option if there is some sort of packet loss. However maybe this is really just some timing issue for the hardware to settle its baud rate. However I assume that the firmware loading itself succeeds here.

Marcel
