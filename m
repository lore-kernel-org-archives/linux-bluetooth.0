Marcel,

I have been looking at the plugin in bluez-utils cvs. Is it working for 
you over rfcomm? (I don't have a headset that supports the rfcomm sbc 
stream any more...)

Do you want to keep rfcomm transport as an option?

Sadly, it looks like the dmix plugin won't give multiple apps access to 
a plugin. The fact that it uses IPC was encouraging, so maybe it will 
work some day.

Brad
