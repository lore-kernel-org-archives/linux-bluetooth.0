If you read hci_ti_probe, you will see it is already there. The
default is 3Mbps and the DT can override that with "max-speed". The
intent is that 3Mbps is the max the device can do and max-speed is
only for board or host limitations. Though I just checked the
datasheet on the 1835 and it can go up to 4364kbps. No datasheets for
wl1283, so I have no idea what the max is.
