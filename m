a lot of people are running everything in H:4 since it is a lot simpler. And since it is all wired so closely, you normally do not have bit error even on high speeds. However at the end of the day it is still an UART and running it without flow control is a bit funky.

I looked a little bit in hci_h5.c and I don’t think it is worth trying to hack serdev support into it. It looks easy on the front, but it feels so hackish. I need to check what it takes to write a plain serdev 3-Wire UART driver that can drive serdev based Broadcom devices directly. Then we might be able to easily extend it with vendor support similar to how we do it in btusb.c.

Marcel
